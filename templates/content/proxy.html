<h1>Intercept and modify a request</h1>

Set up the intercept as noted above and then submit the form/request below by clicking the submit button. When you request is intercepted (hits the breakpoint), modify it as follows.

Change the Method to GET

Add a header 'x-request-intercepted:true'

Remove the request body and instead send 'changeMe' as query string parameter and set the value to 'Requests are tampered easily' (without the single quotes)

Then let the request continue through (by hitting the play button).

Note
The two play buttons behave a little differently, but weâ€™ll let you tinker and figure that out for yourself.

<form action="/proxy" method="post">
	<label for="data">Data</label>
	<input type="text" name="data" id="data">
	<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
