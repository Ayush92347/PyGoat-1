        SQL Introduction
    </h2>

    <p>
        SQL is a language for storing and manipulating data in a database. Data is stored in tables, and accessed with regular queries.<br><br>
        SQL Injection is the use of unsanitized user input as a way of retrieving data that would normally be off-limits to the user. Unsanitized user input is input from the user that the server has not been properly configured to remove the possibility of malicious expressions or queries from being executed.
